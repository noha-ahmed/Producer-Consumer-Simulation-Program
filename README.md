# Producer-Consumer-Simulation-Program
An object-oriented queuing simultation program of an assembly line developed using Javafx and Java Multithreading.
The assembly line consisting of different processing machines that are responsible for processing the product at different stages  and queues to handle product movement between different stages.
Features:
- Users can graphically add Qs and Ms , connect them via UI arbitrarily.
- Each machine has a random service time and can serve on product at a time.
- Each machine is running and processing its products on a seperate thread different from other machines' processing threads.
- The UI shows the simultaion bu displaying the number of elements in the Qs in real time.
- After the simulation ends , the user can start a new simulation or replay the previous simulation.
- every product has its own color (a random color) that will keep it from start till the end and each machine will 
change its color the productâ€™s color being processed by it then change back to a 
default color once done to make following the simulation easy for the user.
